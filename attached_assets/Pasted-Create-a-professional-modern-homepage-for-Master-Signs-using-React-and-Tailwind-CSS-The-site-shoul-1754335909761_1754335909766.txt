Create a professional, modern homepage for Master Signs using React and Tailwind CSS. The site should reflect a bold brand identity inspired by fastsigns.com, buildasign.com, and signarama.com. Master Signs is a faith-driven, family-owned signage company offering services like vehicle wraps, LED boards, and laser engraving. Design should feel innovative, local, and trustworthy.

Design Goals:
- Bold blues, black, and white color palette for clean, high-impact visuals
- Crisp typography, high-contrast accessibility, and strong mobile responsiveness
- Consistent, scalable layout with clear CTAs, soft animations, and generous spacing
- ADA-compliant: alt tags, keyboard navigation, readable fonts, and high-contrast toggles

Homepage Content Sections:
- Dual navigation bars: top for contact/login, bottom for core links (20+ services)
- Hero section with business tagline, location, and strong CTA buttons
- Services section (6–8 cards) featuring laser engraving, LED signs, vehicle wraps, banners
- About section with brand story, legacy, and mission
- Quote request UI: minimal form fields with file upload
- Testimonials slider
- “Explore Design Now” preview with placeholder (canvas not required now)
- Footer with site links, job opportunities, contact info, and social icons

Functionality:
- Search filters by sign type, usage, and material on product pages
- Customer login placeholder with future intent for dashboard integration
- Quote forms to be fully styled with validation (no backend connection needed now)
- Image assets and file upload buttons for future file handling
- Responsive navigation drawer for mobile
- Sticky nav bar on scroll

Preferred Libraries:
- react-router-dom for routing
- framer-motion for subtle animations and transitions
- swiper for testimonial and services sliders
- react-hook-form + yup for form validation
- react-icons for scalable icons
- clsx for dynamic class names
- tailwind-scrollbar and tailwind-typography for enhanced styling

Folder Structure:
- src/
  - assets/ (images, icons, logos)
  - components/ (Navbar, Footer, Hero, ServicesGrid, AboutBlock, QuoteForm, TestimonialSlider)
  - pages/
    - Home.jsx
    - Services.jsx
    - Contact.jsx
  - routes/ (index.jsx)
  - styles/ (tailwind.config.js, global.css)
  - utils/ (constants.js, helpers.js)
  - App.jsx
  - main.jsx

Requirements:
- Clean, scalable React + Tailwind project
- Avoid hardcoded styles — use Tailwind for spacing, responsiveness, and layout
- Use modular, reusable components
- Do not build backend or design canvas now, just front-end placeholders

Target completion: Rapid frontend MVP for visual demos and stakeholder review
