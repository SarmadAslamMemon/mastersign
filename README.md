### âœ… Custom Template Created for Background Testing

I've created a new custom template called **"Custom Banner Template"** specifically designed to test background image rendering. This template includes:

- **Main Banner Area**: A large rectangular area (1000x600) that serves as the background target
- **Heading Text**: Large "MAIN HEADING" text at the top
- **Subheading**: Smaller descriptive text below the heading
- **Note Section**: A green note box with sample text
- **Perfect for Testing**: The main banner area is designed to be the perfect size and position for testing background images

### ðŸŽ¨ How to Test Background Rendering

1. **Load the Custom Template**:
   - Go to `/enhanced-editor`
   - In the left sidebar, click on "Templates" tab
   - Select "Custom Banner Template" from the list

2. **Test Background Image Rendering**:
   - **Option 1**: Click the "Test BG" button (purple button) to generate a random test image
   - **Option 2**: Upload your own image using "Upload Background Image"
   - **Option 3**: Use background presets from the "Presets" button

3. **Select the Banner Area**:
   - Click on the large grey rectangle (Main Banner Area) to select it
   - You'll see blue selection handles around it
   - This is the area where the background will be applied

4. **Apply Background**:
   - After selecting the banner area, click any of the background options
   - The background should now cover ONLY the selected banner area, not the entire canvas

### ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed

- **Background images now cover ONLY the selected template area** instead of the entire canvas
- **No more need to select objects first** for preset backgrounds
- **Proper scaling and positioning** within the template bounds
- **Template-specific backgrounds** that stay within their designated areas

### ðŸ“‹ Template Features

The Custom Banner Template includes:
- **Dimensions**: 1200x800 pixels
- **Category**: Marketing
- **Editable Elements**: All text and shapes can be modified
- **Color Variations**: Blue, Green, Purple, and Orange themes
- **Text Variations**: Business, Event, and Promotion versions

### ðŸ§ª Testing Commands

To test the background rendering:

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Navigate to the enhanced editor
# http://localhost:5000/enhanced-editor

# Load the Custom Banner Template
# Select the main banner area
# Use the "Test BG" button or upload an image
# Verify the background covers only the banner area
```

This template provides the perfect testing environment to verify that background images are properly constrained to their intended areas rather than covering the entire canvas.
